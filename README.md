# :computer: Dual Counter App

### The Dual Counter Application is a simple web-based application that allows users to set the initial and maximum value of the counter, and then increment, decrement, and reset the counter, and also switch from a dual-monitor setup to an integrated one. The application is built using React, Redux, and TypeScript, and it utilizes the localStorage API to persist the counter's state between sessions.
